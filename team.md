## PhD students 

**Jonas Eschenfelder**: Jonas uses numerical modelling and physical experiments, grounded in field observations, to better understand how seasonal changes affect the permafrost and water pathways in the Canadian high Arctic. They hope to use these insights to explore how such landscapes will evolve with a changing climate.

## MSc students 

**Grace Johnson**: Jonas uses numerical modelling and physical experiments, grounded in field observations, to better understand how seasonal changes affect the permafrost and water pathways in the Canadian high Arctic. They hope to use these insights to explore how such landscapes will evolve with a changing climate.

## Postdoctoral research fellows

**Sam Anderson**: Sam researches the hydrological impacts of heatwaves, focusing on the streamflow response to historical extreme events and the spatial and temporal variability of heatwave-precipitation characteristics.
