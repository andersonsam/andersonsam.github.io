# Current members 

## PhD students 

<img src="/assets/img/jonas.jpg" alt="jonas" width="200"/> 

**Jonas Eschenfelder**: Jonas is interested in how ground ice changes sediment transport dynamics to form new channel networks in permafrost regions. To explore this topic, they use flume experiments and field observations from the Canadian High Arctic.

## MSc students 

**Grace Johnson**: Jonas uses numerical modelling and physical experiments, grounded in field observations, to better understand how seasonal changes affect the permafrost and water pathways in the Canadian high Arctic. They hope to use these insights to explore how such landscapes will evolve with a changing climate.

## Postdoctoral research fellows

**Sam Anderson**: Sam researches the hydrological impacts of heatwaves, focusing on the streamflow response to historical extreme events and the spatial and temporal variability of heatwave-precipitation characteristics.
